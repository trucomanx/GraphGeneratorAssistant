        "The dataset to be plotted is stored in the **data** variable. It can be either a pandas DataFrame or a Python dict (OrderedDict recommended). Each column (if DataFrame) or key (if dict) represents a numeric feature, with the column names used as feature labels. Each feature should contain numeric values (int or float) of equal length.\n\nThe class labels for each data point are stored in the **labels** variable. It should be a list, tuple, or pandas Series of the same length as the number of rows in **data**. Each element indicates the class or category of the corresponding data point, which will be used to color the scatter plots in the lower triangle of the correlation matrix."
